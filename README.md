# Known bugs[1]

-   If user scores 0 or times out the submit initials field still appears. This need to be changed in the next release.

# Troubleshooting[7]

-   Start button starts the test
-   View Highscores button displays highscore page
-   Questions have been checked to make sure answer is evaluated correctly and that "Correct" and "Wrong" messages are displayed correctly
-   If "View highscores" is clicked before test is over, the test stops and must be started over by hitting the back button. This has been tested.
-   The initials field correctly takes initials, selects the first three characters entered, converts the characters to upper case, and posts to the highscore screen if in the top 5 scores. This has been tested.
-   Test works correctly if restarted during the test.
-   The clear highscores button works correctly.
